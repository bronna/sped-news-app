Methodology:

1. Downloaded Oregon school district Tiger/Line Shapefiles of school districts
    2018 to match the data
    Modified directory names: tl_2018_41-unsd => oregon_2018_41_unified_sd
        41 is the code for the state of Oregon
    From US Census website: https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php?year=2018&layergroup=School+Districts
    Downloaded Unified SDs, Elementary SDs, and Secondary SDs
2. Downloaded School address data from Oregon Department of Education website: https://www.ode.state.or.us/instID/
    Downloaded a 'daily' extract of all institutions in a zipped Microsoft Excel 8.0 file
    Converted the file from xls to csv on cloudconvert.com
    Decided to just focus on agencies labeled as "EI/ECSE" and "EI/ECSE Service Center" and pasted into new csv
3. Used geocod.io to geocode the agency addresses
4. Uploaded SD shape files and EI agency data to QGIS
5. Exported SD layer data from QGIS as csv so I can match the SD names with the sped data in pandas
6. Matched the SD names in pandas - exported to new data attributes table to upload to QGIS and add as layer
